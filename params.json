{"name":"Light-controllerapi","tagline":"Android Client Library For Light Controller API (Android App)","body":"Light Controller API\r\n====================\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n-----------\r\nAndroid Client Library for [Light Controller Android App](https://github.com/eliotstocker/Light-Controller) allowing your application to control the lighting in a users home with ease and no need to write any socket connections etc.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nLight Controller is available on [BinTray](https://bintray.com/eliotstocker/maven/LightControllerAPI) in the JCenter Repo\r\nThe API can be added into your Gradle dependencies with the following line\r\n```gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile 'Light-ControllerAPI:lightcontrollerapi:1.0.+'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPI Usage is as follows:\r\n\r\n* Add Light Controller Permission to your manifest\r\n```xml\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"tv.piratemedia.lightcontroler.api\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Initialize API\r\n```java\r\nLightControllerAPI api\r\ntry {\r\n    api = new LightControllerAPI(this);\r\n} catch(LightControllerException e) {\r\n    if(e.getCode() == TYPE_APPLICATION_MISSING) {\r\n        //Light Controller application is not installed\r\n        //open store to download Light Controller\r\n        LightControllerAPI.getApplicationFromPlayStore(this);\r\n    } elseif(e.getCode() == TYPE_APPLICATION_OLD) {\r\n        //Light Controller application too old\r\n        //open store to download Latest Light Controller\r\n        LightControllerAPI.getApplicationFromPlayStore(this);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Check if your application is allowed permission to control lights\r\n```java\r\nif(api.hasPermission()) {\r\n            //application has permission\r\n} else {\r\n    //app doesnt have permission, set event for if any permissions change on the api\r\n    api.setOnPermissionChanged(new OnPermissionChanged() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onChange() {\r\n            //still need to check if your app has permission as this is called on any app permission change\r\n            if(api.hasPermission()) {\r\n                perms.setVisibility(View.GONE);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt is not explicityly required that an app must request permission as sending a command (such as light on) will result in a permission request being sent, however it is best use that in any app with a main activity that permissions are requested and checked on create or resume so as to avoid user confusion.\r\nThe Commandr usage for example does not explicitly request permission, thus on first use a permission requested be be sent.\r\n\r\n* Select Zone the user wishes to control\r\nthere are multiple ways to do this\r\n\r\n1: using the Zone List Picker\r\n```java\r\napi.pickZone();\r\n\r\n//register Activity Result Listener withing your activity, required to get the return from the pick activity\r\n@Override\r\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\r\n    if(requestCode == LightControllerAPI.PickRequestCode) {\r\n        if(resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\r\n            //save zone for later use\r\n            Zone = (LightZone)data.getSerializableExtra(\"LightZone\");\r\n            //show user selected zone\r\n            selected.setText(Character.toUpperCase(Zone.Type.charAt(0)) + Zone.Type.substring(1) + \": \" + Zone.Name);\r\n        } else if(resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED) {\r\n            //picker was closed without picking\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2: using LightZone List API\r\n```java\r\nLightZone[] zoneList = api.listZones();\r\n\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < zoneList.length; i++) {\r\n    LightZone zone = zoneList[i];\r\n    Log.d(\"Zone\", \"Name: \"+zone.Name+\" Type: \"+zone.Type);\r\n    \r\n    //do what ever you like with the zones here (add to listView perhapse)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Now you have the zones you can start to control the zones with like the following\r\n```java\r\n//zone1 is a LightZone returned from either Zone List\r\napi.lightsOn(zone1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPI Documentation\r\n-----------------\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\n| Return Type    |
